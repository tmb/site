# ðŸ‘‹ I'm Theo, nice to meet you!

Hey! I'm Theo, I work on AI at [Notion](https://notion.so).

In the past, Iâ€™ve worked on upward mobility for Americans at [Dreambound](https://dreambound.com), [private banking for hackathons](https://hackclub.com/bank) at [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com), [instigated ConstitutionDAO](https://newyorker.com/magazine/2021/12/06/we-the-crypto-people-seek-a-constitution), and repairing the education system at [Synthesis](https://synthesis.com).

In my free time, I'm learning jazz piano and law. I grew up in Massachusetts, and now live in San Francisco.

_Feel free to say hello via e-mail (on my homepage!) â€” I love meeting new people!_
