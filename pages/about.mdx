# ðŸ‘‹ I'm Theo, nice to meet you!

Hey! Iâ€™m Theo, I live in San Francisco and am a software engineer. I work for [Synthesis School](https://synthesis.com) building new ways to educate kids. In the past, Iâ€™ve sent MacBooks to high schoolers in need across the world + built [private banking for hackathons](https://hackclub.com/bank) at [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com), and helped instigate [ConstitutionDAO](https://newyorker.com/magazine/2021/12/06/we-the-crypto-people-seek-a-constitution).   

_(I'd love to meet youâ€”check out my [standing invitation](/invitation))_
