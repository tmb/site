# ðŸ‘‹ I'm Theo, nice to meet you!

Hey! I'm Theo, I live in San Francisco and am a software engineer. I work for [Dreambound](https://dreambound.com) building upward mobility for job seekers. In the past, Iâ€™ve sent MacBooks to high schoolers in need across the world + built [private banking for hackathons](https://hackclub.com/bank) at [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com), instigated [ConstitutionDAO](https://newyorker.com/magazine/2021/12/06/we-the-crypto-people-seek-a-constitution), and worked on improving the education system at [Synthesis](https://synthesis.com). In my free time, I'm learning jazz piano and law.

_(I love meeting new peopleâ€”check out my [standing invitation](/invitation))_
