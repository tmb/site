# ðŸ‘‹ I'm Theo, nice to meet you!

_**TL;DR**: I'm Theo, a 17-year-old hacker. I'm currently the founder of [Libera Logistics](https://libera.delivery), my new company to help startups ship out their swag. Previously, I worked for [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) as a jack-of-all-trades, and before that I started a non-profit called [StuTech Grants](https://grants.stutech.org), giving out $200 to ambitious high school students. The rest of this is mostly outdated as of October 2020._

When I was 11, I wanted to learn how to make a Minecraft mod, so I learned how to code. I really enjoyed it, so I kept going. Eventually I got bored of building for Minecraft, so I learned Node.js and built Discord bots + small web apps using Express.

In 8th grade, I went to my first hackathon and it completely changed my lifeâ€”I discovered a community of people my age that liked technology and problem-solving. Shortly after attending that event, I started [StuTech](https://grants.stutech.org).

StuTech was a non-profit that gave out $200 grants to high school students trying to start something. I learned a lot from thisâ€”how to write cold-emails, how difficult getting users is (as someone once said to me, "you were literally giving money away and people weren't coming"), and how to talk to people. 

We gave out $200 to 3 people. 2/3 grants made a substantial difference to the projects they were given to. I've stopped working on it because I felt that I came up with a half-assed solution to a much larger problem, which is identifying, encouraging, and assisting really ambitious young people. If you think you have novel ideas in this vein, please start something.

During the summer before 9th grade, I found and joined the [Hack Club community](https://hackclub.com/community). I've met some of my best friends there, and it really kicked off my [hackathon](https://mahacks.com) [organizing](https://hackpenn.com) [addiction](https://windyhacks.com).

Right now, I work for [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) wearing a variety of hats, currently mainly software dev, community, and outreach. Until late-March, I worked on [Hack Club Bank](https://hackclub.com/bank/), where I helped us scale from ~$200k in transactions to $1.5mm in transactions and shipped some major features (namely: Checks and ACH + Donations).

I care a lot about getting young folks involved in tech and writing lots of code.

If you've read to here, thank you for indulging me! I'd probably love to meet you, check out my [standing invitation](/invitation).
