# ðŸ‘‹ I'm Theo, nice to meet you!

When I taught myself to code at eleven, I unlocked a new world of creativity and my voice. Iâ€™m trying to use that voice to help other people.

Iâ€™ve spent the past few years building [side projects](https://tempus.im) and helping students become makers and builders instead of passive consumers, through [StuTech Grants](https://grants.stutech.org) early-on, [many](https://2019.windyhacks.com/) [hackathons](https://hackpenn.com), and later [Bank](https://bank.hackclub.com) + a few [other](https://hackclub.com/amas/) [initiatives](https://twitter.com/theombl/status/1263183034519617536) at [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com).

Right now, Iâ€™m trying to figure out what I want to do next. Iâ€™ll let you know when I figure it out. 


_(If you've read this far, I'd love to meet youâ€”check out my [standing invitation](/invitation))_
