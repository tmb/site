# Standing Invitation
<Subtitle>

_this is inspired by [Patrick McKenzie's](https://kalzumeus.com) website_

</Subtitle>

If you are a person, any person, & you want to meet me, please send over an email. My email is my first name at this domain.

I have literally built my (albeit, very small career) on cold-emailing & building relationships with people. I have sent many, many bad emailsâ€”there is nothing that you can/will do that will scare me off. 

Please say hi! I would love to meet you :)
