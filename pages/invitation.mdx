If you want to meet me, I want to meet you -- please say hi! Asking questions of people I look up to has been invaluable to me, and I want to pay it forward to anyone who may feel that way about me (if that's you, I'm honored!)

My email is my first name at this domain. Reach out! I would love to meet you :)
